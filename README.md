# About this project

This project is based on the Udemy course Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide. Within it we create a few different smart contracts on the Ethereum test network Rinkeby, the smart contracts vary from a simple message inbox, to a lottery and finally a version kickstarter.

This repo is the fully completed course that contains minor changes to make it work with the latest versions of web3 etc. My certificate for course completion can be found here:

## Acknowledgement
I would like to give credit to Stephen Grider for creating the excellent course for which I created this repository as my own personal record as proof of completion.

The course was thorough but due to the age of the course some of the code did have to change to meet the latest versions which was the cause of a few issues.
