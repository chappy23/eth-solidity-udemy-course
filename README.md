# About this project

This project follows the Ethereum and Solidity complete dev guide on Udemy, it starts small with a simple smart contract as an Inbox and grows to handle Campaigns in a similar fashion to Kickstart.

## Acknowledgement
I would like to give credit to Stephen Grider for creating the excellent course for which I created this repository as my own personal record as proof of completion.

The course was thorough but due to the age of the course some of the code did have to change to meet the latest versions which was the cause of a few issues.
